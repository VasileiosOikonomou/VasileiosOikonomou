Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the Athens University of Economics and Business, with a strong passion for coding and building innovative solutions ðŸ’¡.

I've been focusing on developing Java-based applications, exploring best practices and design patterns in the ecosystem. 
Additionally, I've been working on C++ projects and building efficient algorithms. My experience also extends to creating dynamic and user-friendly e-commerce websites,
blending both frontend and backend technologies to deliver seamless shopping experiences.
